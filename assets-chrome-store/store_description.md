Previous Tab Keyboard Shortcut 🔄

The extension Chrome should have built themselves... about a decade ago.

WHAT DOES THIS DO?
Ever wanted Ctrl+Tab to switch to your previously focused tab instead of Chrome's default behavior of cycling through tabs like some sort of browser roulette? Yeah, we all have. This extension finally gives you that sanity-saving functionality with simple keyboard shortcuts. No more "where the heck was I?" moments.

THE BACKSTORY:
Once upon a time, extensions like AutoControl could override Chrome's default Ctrl+Tab to make it actually useful. Then Chrome Manifest V3 happened and Google decided we can't have nice things anymore. This extension is our workaround for the basic functionality Chrome still refuses to build.

KEY FEATURES:
🎯 Smart Tab Switching - Alt+W to jump to your previously focused tab
⬅️ Left Tab Navigation - Alt+Q to switch left (wraps around)
➡️ Right Tab Navigation - Alt+E to switch right (wraps around)
🧠 Remembers Everything - Maintains history of last 10 focused tabs
🔄 Handles Closed Tabs - Tries next tab in history if previous was closed
🪟 Multi-Window Support - Works independently in each Chrome window
🚫 No Tab Loss - Never loses track of your tabs
🔄 Session Persistence - Maintains tab history even when tabs go to sleep or are suspended

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Install the extension from Chrome Web Store
2. Go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts
3. Configure your preferred shortcuts (default: Alt+W, Alt+Q, Alt+E)
4. Start browsing - extension learns your patterns automatically

CTRL+TAB WORKAROUND:
Missing Ctrl+Tab? Use Windows PowerToys Keyboard Manager to remap Ctrl+Tab to Alt+W (or your chosen shortcut). This gives you the Ctrl+Tab behavior Chrome should have had all along.

WHY THIS EXTENSION IS BETTER:
Unlike other tab switching extensions, this one:
- Handles closed tabs properly
- Maintains history during tab suspension
- Works in multiple windows
- Actually works like you'd expect

PERMISSIONS NEEDED:
- Storage (for tab history persistence)

This extension exists because Chrome removed the ability to override Ctrl+Tab in Manifest V3. We're just trying to make the best of a frustrating situation.
