WHAT THIS EXTENSION DOES:
Ever wanted Ctrl+Tab to switch to your previously focused tab instead of Chrome's default cycling behavior? This extension gives you that sanity-saving functionality.

KEY FEATURES:
üéØ Smart Tab Switching - Alt+W to jump to your previously focused tab
‚¨ÖÔ∏è Left Tab Navigation - Alt+Q to switch left (wraps around)
‚û°Ô∏è Right Tab Navigation - Alt+E to switch right (wraps around)
üß† Remembers Everything - Maintains history of last 10 focused tabs
üîÑ Handles Closed Tabs - Tries next tab in history if previous was closed
ü™ü Multi-Window Support - Works independently in each Chrome window

DEFAULT SHORTCUTS:
‚Ä¢ Alt+W - Switch to previously active tab
‚Ä¢ Alt+Q - Switch to left tab
‚Ä¢ Alt+E - Switch to right tab

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: After installation, Chrome may not automatically enable the default shortcuts. To check/enable them:
1. Go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts
2. Find "Previous Tab Keyboard Shortcut" Extension
3. Verify shortcuts are set to Alt+W, Alt+Q, Alt+E
4. If not set, click "Edit" and assign the shortcuts manually

CTRL+TAB WORKAROUND:
Want true Ctrl+Tab behavior? Use Windows PowerToys Keyboard Manager along with this extension:

1. Download and install Microsoft PowerToys from the Microsoft Store
2. Open PowerToys Settings
3. Go to "Keyboard Manager" ‚Üí "Remap a key"
4. Click "Add key remapping"
5. Set "Physical Key" to "Ctrl+Tab"
6. Set "Mapped To" to "Alt+W"
7. Click "OK" and restart Chrome

This gives you the Ctrl+Tab behavior Chrome should have had all along.

THE BACKSTORY:
Chrome removed the ability to override Ctrl+Tab in Manifest V3. This extension provides the functionality Chrome refuses to build.

WHY THIS EXTENSION IS BETTER:
Unlike other tab switching extensions, this one:
- Handles closed tabs properly
- Maintains history during tab suspension
- Works in multiple windows
- Actually works like you'd expect

Chrome should have built this feature years ago. Until they do, this extension has you covered.
