Previous Tab Keyboard Shortcut Extension - Chrome's Missing Feature üîÑ

Tired of Chrome's useless Ctrl+Tab behavior that cycles through tabs like you're playing browser roulette? This extension finally gives you the intelligent tab switching Chrome should have had all along - jumping to your PREVIOUSLY focused tab instead of the next one in line.

üîó DOWNLOAD LINK: [Chrome Web Store Link]

WHAT THIS EXTENSION DOES:
‚úÖ Smart tab switching (Alt+W) - jumps to your last focused tab
‚úÖ Left navigation (Alt+Q) - switch to tab on the left
‚úÖ Right navigation (Alt+E) - switch to tab on the right
‚úÖ Remembers your last 10 tabs
‚úÖ Handles closed tabs gracefully
‚úÖ Works across multiple Chrome windows
‚úÖ Maintains history when tabs go to sleep

THE BACKSTORY:
Once upon a time, extensions like AutoControl could override Chrome's default Ctrl+Tab to make it actually useful. Then Chrome Manifest V3 happened and Google decided we can't have nice things anymore. This extension is our workaround for the basic functionality Chrome still refuses to build.

SETUP:
1. Install from Chrome Web Store
2. Go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts
3. Set up Alt+W, Alt+Q, Alt+E shortcuts
4. Browse normally - it learns your patterns

CTRL+TAB WORKAROUND:
Want Ctrl+Tab to work properly? Use Windows PowerToys to remap Ctrl+Tab to Alt+W. Full tutorial in the video above.

WHY THIS EXTENSION IS BETTER:
Unlike other tab switching extensions, this one:
- Handles closed tabs properly
- Maintains history during tab suspension
- Works in multiple windows
- Actually works like you'd expect

Chrome should have built this feature years ago. Until they do, this extension has you covered.
